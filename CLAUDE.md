# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

**Army Ghosts** — a web-based, mobile-first, top-down 2D shooter (old-PC *Army
Men* feel) that will grow Ghost Recon Wildlands *Ghost War* mechanics (stealth,
hiding in bushes, squad modes). Built on **Bevy 0.18** with fully deterministic
**peer-to-peer rollback multiplayer**: GGRS over matchbox WebRTC. The only
server anywhere is a matchbox *signaling* server (runs on the dev Mac); game
traffic is p2p and the sim is replayed identically on every peer.

Reference project: `~/bad-spaceship` (same author's 3D server-authoritative
game). Its CLAUDE.md documents most of the toolchain/deploy patterns this repo
reuses (Pages CI, Tailscale serving, wasm pitfalls). This project deliberately
differs: 2D, integer determinism, p2p rollback instead of lightyear
client-server.

## Version pins (read before touching Cargo.toml)

All engine-coupled versions live in `[workspace.dependencies]` in the root
`Cargo.toml`. **Bevy is deliberately 0.18, not 0.19**: the released netcode set
is bevy 0.18 + bevy_matchbox 0.14 + matchbox_socket 0.14 (`ggrs` feature) +
bevy_ggrs 0.20 + ggrs 0.11.1. bevy_ggrs 0.21+/ggrs 0.12+ break matchbox's
NonBlockingSocket impl; bevy_matchbox has no 0.19 release yet (checked
2026-07-24). Bump everything together when matchbox ships 0.19 support.

Other pins:
- Rust **1.97.1** via `rust-toolchain.toml`; `Cargo.lock` committed — build
  with `--locked` (build scripts do).
- `wasm-bindgen` crate pinned `=0.2.126` (client/Cargo.toml) and CLI version
  in `tools/build-web.sh` — the CLI rejects a version-mismatched module; bump
  both together. The CLI is auto-fetched into `target/tools/`, never installed
  globally (other projects on this machine pin different versions).

## Build & run

```bash
# Native dev loop (synctest/local mode):
cargo run -p army-ghosts-client --features native

# Native p2p test (per instance):
AG_ROOM=test AG_PLAYERS=2 AG_SIGNALING=ws://127.0.0.1:3536 cargo run -p army-ghosts-client --features native

# Web build → _site/ (fetches the pinned wasm-bindgen CLI on first run):
tools/build-web.sh            # release; --debug for a debug build
python3 -m http.server -d _site 8080
```

`client` needs exactly one of `native` / `web` on top of `default`
(the web build is `--no-default-features --features default,web`).

URL params (parsed by index.html into `window.__AG_NET__` pre-WASM):
`?room=CODE&players=N&signaling=wss://…`. No `room` ⇒ local synctest mode.
Native equivalents: `AG_ROOM`, `AG_PLAYERS`, `AG_SIGNALING` env vars.

## Architecture

- **`sim/`** (`army-ghosts-sim`) — the deterministic core. Integer-only: i32
  fixed-point positions (`FP = 256` subunits per world-unit/pixel), integer
  velocity/collision/isqrt math. All tick-state components are registered for
  GGRS rollback (snapshot/restore) and `Pos` is checksummed for desync
  detection. Generic over the ggrs `Config` so it never depends on matchbox.
  Runs in `GgrsSchedule` at `TICK_HZ` (60).
- **`client/`** — rendering (sprites; the ONLY place fixed-point → f32, via
  `Pos::to_f32`), input collection (`ReadInputs` schedule → `LocalInputs`),
  session bring-up (`net.rs`: launch-config parsing, matchbox socket,
  GGRS session build), camera follow.
- **`client/index.html`** — instant-paint loader (progress bar, streams the
  wasm, parses URL params before init). Mobile hardening: devicePixelRatio cap
  (1.5) so iOS Safari's GPU governor doesn't throttle, touch-action none,
  iOS tab-suspension reload recovery.

### Determinism rules (the whole point — do not bend)

1. **No floats in `sim/`.** Positions, velocities, collision tests, isqrt —
   all integer. Rendering may use floats freely but nothing flows back.
2. No randomness, no time reads, no HashMap-iteration-order dependence, no
   query-iteration-order-sensitive logic in the sim (when order matters, sort
   by a stable key first).
3. Every component that evolves over ticks must be rollback-registered in
   `SimPlugin`, and anything worth checksumming should be.
4. Desync detection stays ON (`DesyncDetection::On` + `Pos` checksums). A
   desync event is always a bug; local synctest mode (`run without a room`,
   GGRS re-simulates every frame) is the canary — keep it working.

### Netcode model

- **bevy_ggrs rollback**: peers exchange only `PlayerInput` (3 bytes:
  quantized i8 move x/y + button bitflags), each peer simulates everything.
- **Matchmaking**: matchbox room string from `?room=`; the socket URL is
  `{signaling}/{room}?next={players}` (`next_N` closes the room at N peers).
  Handle order = matchbox's sorted `players()` list, identical on all peers.
- 2 players for milestone 1; `MAX_PLAYERS = 4` designed in (spawn points,
  session builder loops — grow by changing constants).

## Gotchas already hit (don't rediscover)

- **`bevy/bevy_sprite_render` feature is required** on top of `bevy_sprite`.
  Bevy 0.17's render-crate split moved sprite rendering out; without it
  sprites exist, pass visibility (ViewVisibility=true), and silently never
  draw — empty clear-colored screen, no error.
- **ggrs 0.11 inputs are serde types**, not bytemuck Pod (that was older
  ggrs): derive `Serialize`/`Deserialize` on the input struct.
- **bevy_ggrs 0.20 API**: the app-extension trait is `RollbackApp`
  (`rollback_component_with_copy`, `checksum_component_with_hash`); tick rate
  is the `RollbackFrameRate` resource; desync event is
  `GgrsEvent::DesyncDetected`.
- **bevy_matchbox 0.14**: `MatchboxSocket::new_unreliable(url)` (the old
  `new_ggrs` constructor is gone); it's both a Resource and a Component;
  matchbox's `ggrs` feature impls NonBlockingSocket on `WebRtcChannel`.
- **getrandom on wasm**: `.cargo/config.toml` sets
  `getrandom_backend="wasm_js"`; the client `web` feature enables the
  matching `wasm_js`/`js` features for the getrandom 0.3 and 0.2 lines in the
  graph.
- **Headless browser testing**: playwright chromium lives in
  `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/`; launch with
  `--use-gl=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader --no-sandbox`. Chrome's
  `--virtual-time-budget` screenshots are unreliable for wasm games — drive
  with playwright and real waits instead.
- **Headless-to-headless WebRTC additionally needs
  `--disable-features=WebRtcHideLocalIpsWithMdns`** — headless Chrome can't
  resolve the mDNS-obfuscated host candidates, and the srflx fallback needs
  NAT hairpinning, so data channels never open without it. Sessions in the
  headless swiftshader environment take 60-90s to reach "starting p2p
  session" (huge debug wasm + software rendering) — poll patiently.
- **The vendored matchbox trickle-ICE patch** (`vendor/matchbox_socket/`, see
  `[patch.crates-io]` in the root Cargo.toml): upstream matchbox waits for
  ICE gathering to COMPLETE before sending the offer/answer. On
  multi-interface machines (Tailscale utuns!) browsers hit the full ~40s
  STUN transaction timeout per handshake leg → 80s+ connects that read as
  "p2p is broken". The patch sends offer/answer immediately and trickles
  candidates (both matchbox signal loops already buffer early candidates).
  Native (webrtc-rs) never had the wait — that's why native p2p worked while
  web stalled. Diagnose future regressions by diffing the two.
- **STUN itself is fine on this network** (verified: 28-47ms responses via
  python/node UDP probes) — do not blame the router when browser ICE is slow;
  it's the per-interface STUN timeout above.

## Testing

- Native smoke: run without a room (synctest re-simulates every frame — it
  catches nondeterminism AND rollback-unsafe state immediately).
- Web smoke: `tools/build-web.sh` + local http.server + headless chromium
  screenshot (see scratchpad pattern; keyboard works via playwright's
  `page.keyboard`).
- Two-peer local test: run `matchbox_server` (installed via
  `cargo install matchbox_server --version 0.14.0`, listens on `0.0.0.0:3536`),
  open two browser tabs with `?room=X` (or two native instances with
  `AG_ROOM=X`; native connects in ~1s and is the fast way to test session
  logic). Fastest full check: two native instances, staggered by a few
  seconds; assert "starting p2p session" + no DESYNC lines in both logs.

## Deployment (planned; mirrors bad-spaceship)

- Dev: build on this Mac, serve `_site/` + `matchbox_server` over Tailscale
  (`tailscale serve` gives the MagicDNS TLS that makes `wss://` work from
  phones).
- Prod: GitHub Actions → Pages (source must be "GitHub Actions", not branch —
  see bad-spaceship CLAUDE.md "Deployment" for the Jekyll-conflict tell-tales).
  The signaling server needs public reachability for non-tailnet players
  (tailscale funnel, later).
